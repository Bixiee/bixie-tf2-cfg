On this main folder the only .cfg's are the AUTOEXEC.CFG and MISC.CFG
Class-Specific configs will be stored on the /DIR/CLASSESS/ folder
Graphics will be on the /DIR/GRPX/ folder 
Anything else goes on MISC.CFG
(BIGGER MISC SCRIPTS SHOULD HAVE THEIR OWN FILE SO THEY CAN BE ALIASED. (DIR/BIGMISC/))

**(also all files, when put in the game folder, should be in the same folder btw)**

the "built" config should be placed on the /DIR/FINAL/ folder

(**stuff that needs to be done is highlighted like this**)
