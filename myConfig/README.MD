## My tf2 cfg thingy
### *To install just clone the repo and put all the files directly on /Team Fortress 2/tf/cfg/* 

 
 
 #### I recommend, before actually using the config, that you go to the misc.cfg file and change some things (particularly sensitivity) to be more to your liking

TODO: 

> - [x] Finish class cfgs (/ClassCFGs/)

> - [x] bind voicerecord

> - [ ] bind noclip to something (not V)

> - [ ] items can't be picked up even though +use_action_slot_item is bound. binding it to a non-mouse key could work?
